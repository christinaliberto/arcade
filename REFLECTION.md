1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code of the project, read through the project description,
   wrote a scene graph for the two games we are going to create, and implemented the main application
   requirements (a basic set up fulfilling all the requirements). 

2. **TODO:** Finish the design of our main application, begin work on constructing
   each individual game, and work on the attributions for the images we have been
   using. 

3. **PROB:** At first, we had issues in regards to gitHub, mainly the problem with pushing
   and pulling each other's work without deleting any work we had done separately as well.
   With some practice, though, we were able to work through this problem and effectively
   utilize gitHub.

1. **DONE:** Made a new text design for our main menu, which included making the text red
   and adding a shadow reflection. In addition, we imported the game boards for both tetris
   and mancala, setting the mancala game board to a wooden design and the tetris game
   board to a plain black fill. We wrote some pseudo code for the both games to try
   and eliminate any errors once we begin the implementation of both.

2. **TODO:** Begin implementing the code of the games to produce some functionality
   and work on the visual aspect of our main menu and the games itself. We also need
   to include attributions for any new images we have pulled from the internet.

3. **PROB:** We ran into some issues when attempting to set the backgrounds of the
   games, which took up a great deal of time. However, we realized that we were
   making a simple mistake. In addition, we ran into some issues trying to format
   our main menu, but after playing around with the different styles, we were able
   to overcome this issue.
