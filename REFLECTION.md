1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code of the project, read through the project description,
   wrote a scene graph for the two games we are going to create, and implemented the main application
   requirements (a basic set up fulfilling all the requirements). 

2. **TODO:** Finish the design of our main application, begin work on constructing
   each individual game, and work on the attributions for the images we have been
   using. 

3. **PROB:** At first, we had issues in regards to gitHub, mainly the problem with pushing
   and pulling each other's work without deleting any work we had done separately as well.
   With some practice, though, we were able to work through this problem and effectively
   utilize gitHub.
